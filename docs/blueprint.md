# **App Name**: KrishiAI

## Core Features:

- Smart Field Zones: Enable farmers to draw editable polygons on satellite maps to define smart field zones, capturing crop type, acre count (auto-calculated or manual), and planting date for each field.
- AI Crop Monitoring & Prediction: Tool that pulls satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, Landsat, and ISRO Bhuvan, plus weather data from IMD. Calculates NDVI, soil moisture, and crop stress indicators. Leverages an AI model (ResNet-50 or ViT on Hugging Face) to predict drought/flood risk, pest/disease likelihood, and yield anomalies.
- Insight Visualization: Provide personalized field-level summaries presented via color-coded maps and time-series charts for easy consumption on Android or the web
- Secure and Accessible Platform: Implement Firebase Authentication and multilingual support with a voice-enabled interface to support easy adoption
- External API Integrations: Develop an API that integrates with external data sources like GEE, ISRO Bhuvan, IMD, and e-NAM.
- AI-Powered Pest & Disease Detection: Leverage AI for pest and disease detection via image recognition using images uploaded by farmers. Tool will identify what actions farmer needs to take to deal with the pest or disease
- MRV Digitization: Facilitate the digitization of farm record data collection, and generation of reports required for carbon credit calculation, verification, and reporting.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#6B8E23), evoking nature and agriculture.
- Background color: Soft, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC), offering a gentle contrast.
- Accent color: Warm gold (#FFD700), for highlighting key information and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, for a blend of modernity and readability suited for on-screen use, for headlines and body text. Prioritize icon use and minimize text to focus attention
- Use intuitive and easily recognizable icons throughout the interface, with brief descriptive labels. Examples include crop icons (wheat, rice, corn), weather icons (sun, rain, cloud), alert icons (exclamation mark, warning sign), and action icons (upload, save, share). Align icons with the theme.
- Simple layouts featuring large icons and minimal text, maximizing space on mobile devices. Focus on visual cues and reduce the need for extensive reading. Only ask for Farmer Name and Crop Details.
- Use animations sparingly, only for key actions like updating the weather forecast, providing a reward system. Keep animations subtle, so as not to distract.
